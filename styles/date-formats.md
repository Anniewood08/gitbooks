# Date formats

Make sure dates cannot be confused. Use one of the following formats as needed.

### Month, day, and year <a href="#month-day-and-year" id="month-day-and-year"></a>

Format dates with an abbreviation of the month, the date, and the full year.&#x20;

_**MMM DD, YYYY**_  (e.g., _Apr 19, 1999_)

* MMM: Include a 3 letter month abbreviation. By writing an abbreviation for the month name instead of a number, it removes any ambiguity over which value is the day or month (e.g., 01 02 1999 could mean January 2 or February 1).&#x20;
* DD: Include either a 1 or 2-digit date (e.g., 1 or 12). Do not include a zero before a single-digit date.&#x20;
* YYYY: Include the 4-digit year.&#x20;
