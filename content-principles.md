# Content principles

These content principles will help make the user experience helpful and simple for our users. When writing for users, you should

### Lead with the benefit <a href="#lead-with-the-benefit" id="lead-with-the-benefit"></a>

To quickly engage users, start with why they should take an action.

| Like this                                 | Not this                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| :white\_check\_mark: Get paid quicker by… | :no\_entry: Send your project updates daily to… |

### Think like a user <a href="#think-like-a-user" id="think-like-a-user"></a>

As you write, think like a user. Be clear, concise, and informative. Organize and write in a way that helps users, giving them both direction and reassurance.&#x20;

### Use consistent terms <a href="#use-consistent-terms" id="use-consistent-terms"></a>

Use consistent terms throughout the app to build trust with users. Consistency and clarity produce an easy and understandable user experience. See [Word Choice](word-choice.md) for product specific terms.&#x20;

### Build a clear, scannable structure <a href="#build-a-clear-scannable-structure" id="build-a-clear-scannable-structure"></a>

Build a clear, repeating information hierarchy so that users can quickly read and understand information. See [Styles](styles/) for how to write and style specific types of content.

* Use headings
* Use bulleted lists to list items
* Use numbered lists for steps or sequences
* Use tables to provide details about a list of information

### Highlight important information <a href="#highlight-important-information" id="highlight-important-information"></a>

Make important information stand out. Allow users to easily scan for important terms and steps, and then provide a way to read more information.

* List clearly
* Bold or italicize important information

### Link clearly <a href="#link-clearly" id="link-clearly"></a>

Make sure that users know what they should do, their next action, and the outcome of their action.

* Use clear, descriptive language
* Tell the user the result of their click

### Answer questions <a href="#answer-questions" id="answer-questions"></a>

Answer user questions with tooltips or microcopy.

### Avoid filler words <a href="#avoid-filler-words" id="avoid-filler-words"></a>

To reduce word and character counts, remove vague filler words:&#x20;
