# Tone

Generally, use a casual, friendly tone to speak directly to users. Keep text concise but not too formal.&#x20;

* **Errors**: If an error occurs, be informative and concise. Do not make light of the situation or blame the user.&#x20;
* **Onboarding**: During onboarding activities (e.g., welcome messages and emails), limited extra enthusiasm (e.g., _Great!_) can be expressed to encourage new users.
